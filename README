This repo contains two different work-in-progress attempts at touch
gesture support libraries.

The first is gestures.js (and test.html). It supports two-finger
gestures pinch and twist gestures and is extensible, but the problem
is that it doesn't interoperate well with one finger gestures.

The second is GestureDetector.js (and test2.html) which is
non-extensible but supports a fairly full set of one and two-finger
gestures by default.

Both were written for use in https://github.com/andreasgal/gaia, but
I'm also releasing them here because they might be of more general
utility.

Neither one is ready for use in production code yet.

The test.html and test2.html files in this repo currently use the
style.MozTransform attribute, so they only work in Gecko-based
browsers.
