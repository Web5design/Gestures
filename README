This module defines an extensible multi-touch gesture event framework
and includes built-in support for two-finger transform (scale, rotate, 
translate) gestures such as pinch-to-zoom and twist-to-rotate.

This module was written for use in https://github.com/andreasgal/gaia,
but I'm also releasing it here because it might be of more general
utility.

The test.html file in this repo currently uses style.MozTransform
attribute, so it only works in Gecko-based browsers. It has been
tested in Firefox nightly for Android and in the B2G browser, but I
suppose it ought to work in other browsers if you change the prefix.
